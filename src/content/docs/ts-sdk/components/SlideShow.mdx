The `SlideShow` component serves as utility to chain series of scene one after the other. It can only accept `Slide` components as children.
After it is mounted it will start showing slides sequentially one after the other. How long single slide shows up is evaluated as follows:
- If `durationMs` is specified it takes precedence.
- If any of child components (not necessarily direct child) are `InputStream`, `Mp4`, or another `SlideShow` then it will stay on that slide for as long as they are running.
- If there are not child components that can extend the Slide lifetime then after 1 second it will switch to the next slide.
