TypeScript SDK is a library that provides a set of React components, hooks, and utility
functions you can use to control video composition in Smelter.

## Runtime

There are different variants of the SDK, each designed to allow Smelter to run in a specific environment.
The rendering process can be divided into two main parts: the TypeScript code that defines the video layout
using React components, and the media processing that renders the actual video. To select your optimal
setup, you need to decide where each of these steps should be executed.

- ##### <Badge text="Node.js" variant="tip" size="large" />
  **NPM package**: `@swmansion/smelter-node`

  It allows you to control a Smelter server from the Node.js process. In this approach your React
  code runs inside Node.js process, and any updates to the React component tree are transmitted to
  the Smelter server as layout updates over HTTP requests. By default, the Smelter server is automatically
  launched on the same machine as Node.js, but you may choose to deploy it independently and simply
  provide the library with the connection URL.

- ##### <Badge text="Browser (Client)" variant="tip" size="large" />
  **NPM package**: `@swmansion/smelter-web-client`

  It allows you to control a Smelter server from within the browser. In this approach, your React
  code runs inside the client's browser, and any updates to the React component tree are transmitted
  to the Smelter server as layout updates over HTTP requests. There is no way to start a server from
  inside the browser, so the library must be provided with the connection URL to an already deployed
  instance.

- ##### <Badge text="Browser (WASM)" variant="tip" size="large" />
  **NPM package**: `@swmansion/smelter-web-wasm`

  It allows you to run the entire Smelter rendering engine directly in the browser. In this approach,
  your React code runs inside the client's browser, and any updates to the React component tree are
  handled by the WASM module running in a separate Web Worker. Since the engine is compiled to WebAssembly,
  it handles all media processing and output generation locally, eliminating the need for a separate Smelter server.

### Components
Smelter TypeScript SDK draws heavy inspiration from React Native in terms of the syntax. It's important to note that standard DOM components, such as `<div/>`, are not supported. Instead, you should use Smelter-specific components, such as:
- [Image](/ts-sdk/components/image)
- [InputStream](/ts-sdk/components/inputstream)
- [Mp4](/ts-sdk/components/mp4)
- [Rescaler](/ts-sdk/components/rescaler)
- [Shader](/ts-sdk/components/shader)
- [Show](/ts-sdk/components/show)
- [SlideShow](/ts-sdk/components/slideshow)
- [Text](/ts-sdk/components/text)
- [Tiles](/ts-sdk/components/tiles)
- [View](/ts-sdk/components/view)
- [WebView](/ts-sdk/components/webview)

#### Styling
Smelter components can be customized in a way similar to React inline styling. Most of the components accept `style` prop - an object defining custom visual aspects. However, some of the animation-related customizations, such as `transition` are handled by specific dedicated props.

<Aside type="caution">Despite some of the component names overlapping with React Native, the supported styles differ. Visit a specific component section to see supported styles.</Aside>

### Hooks
Our hooks are primarily designed for managing stream configurations and accessing information about them. Smelter currently offers following hooks:
- [useInputStreams](/ts-sdk/hooks/use-input-streams)
- [useAudioInput](/ts-sdk/hooks/use-audio-input)
- [useAfterTimestamp](/ts-sdk/hooks/use-after-timestamp)
- [useBlockingTask](/ts-sdk/hooks/use-blocking-task)

You're free to use any standard React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and more.

### Inputs

You can handle most of the stream composing by using React components. However, delivering multimedia to
Smelter requires registering the input beforehand. You can register an input by using `Smelter.registerInput`,
which accepts `inputId` and object representing input configurations. Supported inputs depend on the runtime.

Look for <Badge text="Node.js" variant="tip" size="small" />, <Badge text="Browser (Client)" variant="tip" size="small" />, or
<Badge text="Browser (WASM)" variant="tip" size="small" /> tags in the input documentation to check which runtime is supported.

Node.js o Browser (Client):
- [MP4](/ts-sdk/inputs/mp4)
- [RTP](/ts-sdk/inputs/rtp)
- [HLS](/ts-sdk/inputs/hls)
- [WHIP server](/ts-sdk/inputs/whip)
- [WHEP client](/ts-sdk/inputs/whep)
- [RTMP server](/ts-sdk/inputs/rtmp)
- [Video for Linux 2](/ts-sdk/inputs/v4l2)

Browser (WASM):
- [MP4](/ts-sdk/inputs/mp4) (limited API compared to Node.js)
- [Camera (Web API)](/ts-sdk/inputs/wasm-camera)
- [Screen capture (Web API)](/ts-sdk/inputs/wasm-screen)
- [MediaStream (Web API)](/ts-sdk/inputs/wasm-stream)
- [WHEP client (Web API)](/ts-sdk/inputs/wasm-whep)

After registering the stream, you can use it in composition by using [InputStream](/ts-sdk/components/inputstream) component.

```tsx
<InputStream inputId="example_input" />
```

### Outputs
Similar to inputs, outputs require registering them before they can be utilized. You can register an output by using `Smelter.registerOutput`.

Look for <Badge text="Node.js" variant="tip" size="small" />, <Badge text="Browser (Client)" variant="tip" size="small" />, or
<Badge text="Browser (WASM)" variant="tip" size="small" /> tags in the output documentation to check which runtime is supported.

Node.js:
- [MP4](/ts-sdk/outputs/mp4)
- [RTP](/ts-sdk/outputs/rtp)
- [HLS](/ts-sdk/outputs/hls)
- [WHIP client](/ts-sdk/outputs/whip)
- [WHEP server](/ts-sdk/outputs/whep)
- [RTMP client](/ts-sdk/outputs/rtmp)

Browser (WASM)
- [Canvas (Web APi)](/ts-sdk/outputs/wasm-canvas)
- [MediaStream (Web API)](/ts-sdk/outputs/wasm-stream)
- [WHIP client (Web API)](/ts-sdk/outputs/wasm-whip)

### Resources
Other than inputs and outputs Smelter supports a few other entity types that need to be registered.
- [Shader](/ts-sdk/resources/shader)
- [Image](/ts-sdk/resources/image)
- [WebRenderer](/ts-sdk/resources/web-renderer)
