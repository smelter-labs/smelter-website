Configuration instructions and compatibility table for TypeScript SDK
on different runtimes.

## Node.js

**Package:** `@swmansion/smelter-node`

React code runs in the Node.js process and controls Smelter server.
Managed server does not have to be deployed on the same machine.

### Compatibility

Node.js SDK requires

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SDK version</th>
      <th>Smelter server version</th>
      <th>React version</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>`v0.2.0`</strong></td>
      <td><strong>`v0.4.0`</strong></td>
      <td>
        Recommended: `18.3.1`

        Should work with any react version that is compatible with
        `react-reconciler@0.29.2`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Browser (WASM)

**Package:** `@swmansion/smelter-web-wasm`

React code runs in the browser, potentially along the separate React
code that runs to actually render the page. Actual video rendering
is done fully in-browser by Smelter code compiled to WASM.

### Compatibility

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SDK version</th>
      <th>Supported browsers</th>
      <th>React version</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>`v0.2.0`</strong></td>
      <td>
        Google Chrome and other Chromium based browsers
      </td>
      <td>
        Recommended: `18.3.1`

        Should work with any react version that is compatible with
        `react-reconciler@0.29.2`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### Configuration

In the Smelter repository you can find [few examples](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/tree/master/demos)
of `vite` projects with Smelter configured.

We are working on examples of other configurations, but here are steps you need to follow
to configure that yourself:
- `@swmansion/smelter-browser-render` includes `smelter.wasm` that needs to hosted on your site.
- You need to call `setWasmBundleUrl` with URL to `smelter.wasm` before starting any smelter instances.
