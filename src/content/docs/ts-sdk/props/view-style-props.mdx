### Props

#### width
Width of a component in pixels.

- Type: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `width` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

#### height
Height of a component in pixels.

- Type: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `height` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

#### direction
Defines how static children are positioned inside a View component.

- Type: `"row" | "column"`
- Default value: `"row"`
- Supported values:
    - `"row"` - Children are positioned from left to right.
    - `"column"` - Children are positioned from top to bottom.

---

#### top
Specifies the distance in pixels from the top edge of this component to the top edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### right
Specifies the distance in pixels from the right edge of this component to the right edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### bottom
Specifies the distance in pixels from the bottom edge of this component to the bottom edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### left
Specifies the distance in pixels from the left edge of this component to the left edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### rotation
Specifies the rotation of a component, measured in degrees. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### overflow
Controls the behaviour of the content exceeding the area size.

- Type: `"visible" | "hidden" | "fit"`
- Default value: `"hidden"`
- Supported values:
    - `"visible"` - Render everything, including content that extends beyond their parent.
    - `"hidden"` - Render only parts of the children that are inside their parent area.
    - `"fit"` - If children components are too big to fit inside the parent, resize everything inside to fit.

<Aside>When using `fit`, components with unknown sizes are treated as if they had a size of 0 when calculating the scaling factor.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">`fit` will resize everything inside the parent, including absolutely positioned elements.</Aside>

---

#### backgroundColor
Background color in `#RRGGBBAA` or `#RRGGBB` format.

- Type: `string`
- Default value: `#00000000`
