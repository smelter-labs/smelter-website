In this guide, you'll learn how layouts in Smelter works and how to position and resize components.
It includes examples and explanation how component size is calculated.

<Steps>

1. Init Smelter and connect inputs and outputs

    Start Smelter server, register inputs (`input_1`, `input_2`) and register video output (`output_1`) similarly to examples shown in [`Quick start`](/http-api/guides/quick-start) guide.

    After configuration, you should see the following output:

    <img src={Step1Image.src} alt="Basic layouts - intial" />

2. Add `input_1` to the scene.
    ```http
    POST: /api/output/output_1/update
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "video": {
        "root": {
          "type": "view",
          "background_color": "#4d4d4d",
          "children": [
            { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_1" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The input stream in the example has a resolution `1920x1080`, but it is rendered
    on the `1270x720` output. as a result only part of the stream is visible.

    <img src={Step2Image.src} alt="basic layouts - add input" />


3. Resize `input_1` to fill the output.
    ```http
    POST: /api/output/output_1/update
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "video": {
        "root": {
          "type": "view",
          "background_color": "#4d4d4d",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "rescaler",
              "child": { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_1" }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Input stream now fully fits inside the output.

    Explanation:
    - Root `View` component in the example takes it size from the output itself (`1280x720`).
    - `Rescaler` is the only child without width/height specified, so it takes its size from the `View` component.
    - `InputStream` is resized by `Rescaler` to fit inside it.

    <Aside>
    The same effect (for single input) could be achieved by either:
    - Setting `InputStream` as a root directly. It would only work if aspect ratio of input and output is the same.
    - Replacing `View` component with a `Rescaler`.
    </Aside>

4. Show both inputs side-by-side.
    ```http
    POST: /api/output/output_1/update
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "video": {
        "root": {
          "type": "view",
          "background_color": "#4d4d4d",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "rescaler",
              "child": { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_1" }
            },
            {
              "type": "rescaler",
              "child": { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_2" }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Both input streams are now visible.
    
    Explanation:
    - Root `View` component in the example takes it size from the output itself (`1280x720`).
    - Root `View` has 2 child components, each without any dimensions specified, so both child
      components (`Rescaler`) will have size `640x720`.
    - `InputStream` is resized by `Rescaler` to fit inside it. Aspect ratio does not match,
      so it is centered vertically.

5. Put one of the inputs in the corner 
    ```http
    POST: /api/output/output_1/update
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "video": {
        "root": {
          "type": "view",
          "background_color": "#4d4d4d",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "rescaler",
              "child": { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_1" }
            },
            {
              "type": "rescaler",
              "width": 320,
              "height": 180,
              "top": 20,
              "right": 20,
              "child": { "type": "input_stream", "input_id": "input_2" }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Both input streams are now visible.
    
    Explanation:
    - Root `View` component in the example takes it size from the output itself (`1280x720`)
    - Root `View` has 2 child components, but only one is positioned statically.
      (See [absolute positioning](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts/#absolute-positioning))
      - First `Rescaler` is the only static child of the View, so it has the same size as its
        parent
      - Second `Rescaler` has fields `top` and `right` defined so it is positioned absolutely.
        It is rendered on top of static content of the View and it does not affect layout of 
        the other sibling components.
    - `InputStream` components are resized by `Rescaler` components to fit inside them.
