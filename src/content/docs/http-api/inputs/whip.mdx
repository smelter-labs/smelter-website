import { Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

An input type that allows streaming video and audio to Smelter over WHIP. 

Smelter exposes WHIP endpoint on port 9000 under `/whip/:input_id` route. A different port can be
configured with [`SMELTER_WHIP_WHEP_SERVER_PORT`](/deployment/configuration#smelter_whip_whep_server_port).

To connect new input, register it first with [`register-input` request](/http-api/routes#register-input)
and then establish WHIP connection.

The `bearer token` will be returned as response to the input registration.

## Usage

To use WHIP Input you must register it first. You can do it by sending a request like this:

<CollapsibleDetails summaryTitle='Example request' open>

```http
POST: /api/input/:input_id/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "whip",
  "video": {
    "decoder_preferences": ["ffmpeg_h264", "any"]
  }
}
```
</CollapsibleDetails>

<Aside>
In the following example, both the audio and video will be used if the source provides audio and video tracks:
```http
POST: /api/input/:input_id/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "whip"
}
```
</Aside>

## Reference

<CollapsibleDetails summaryTitle='Type definitions' open>

```tsx
type WhipInput = {
  type: "whip";
  video?: InputWhipVideoOptions;
  required?: bool;
  offset_ms?: f64;
};
```
</CollapsibleDetails>

Parameters for registering an WHIP endpoint as an input.

## Properties

### video
Parameters of a video source included in the WHIP stream.

- **Type**: [`InputWhipVideoOptions`](#inputwhipvideooptions)

---

### required
Determines if the input stream is essential for output frame production. If set to true and the stream is delayed, Smelter will postpone output frames until the stream is received.

- **Type**: `bool`
- **Default value**: `false`

---

### offset_ms
Offset in milliseconds relative to the pipeline start (start request). If unspecified, the stream synchronizes based on the delivery time of the initial frames.

- **Type**: `f64`

## InputWhipVideoOptions
Parameters of a video source included in the WHIP stream.

<CollapsibleDetails summaryTitle='Type definitions' open>
```tsx
type InputWhipVideoOptions = {
    decoder_preferences?: WhipVideoDecoder[];
};
```
</CollapsibleDetails>

### Properties

#### decoder_preferences
An ordered list of preferred video decoders. The first element in the list has the highest priority during WHIP negotiation.
- **Type**: [`WhipVideoDecoder`](#whipvideodecoder)[]
- **Default value**: `[ "any" ]`

Behavior:
- If the list ends with "any":
  - Smelter will first try the decoders explicitly listed (in order) and use the first one that is supported and negotiated in WHIP signaling.
  - If none of the listed decoders are supported, Smelter will fall back to any supported codec from the negotiated list that wasnâ€™t already in the preferences.

- If "any" is not included:
  - Only the decoders listed will be considered.
  - If none are supported, no fallback will occur.

## WhipVideoDecoder
Video decoder type.

<CollapsibleDetails summaryTitle='Type definitions' open>
```tsx
type WhipVideoDecoder =
  | "ffmpeg_h264"
  | "ffmpeg_vp8"
  | "ffmpeg_vp9"
  | "vulkan_h264"
  | "any";
```
</CollapsibleDetails>

- **Type**: "ffmpeg_h264" | "ffmpeg_vp8" | "ffmpeg_vp9" | "vulkan_h264" | "any"
- **Supported values**:
  - `"ffmpeg_h264"` - Software H264 decoder based on FFmpeg.
  - `"vulkan_h264"` (<Badge text="Required feature:vk-video" variant="note" />) - Hardware decoder based on Vulkan Video.
    
    This should be faster and more scalable than the FFmpeg decoder, if the hardware and OS
    support it.
    
    This requires hardware that supports Vulkan Video. Another requirement is this program has
    to be compiled with the `vk-video` feature enabled (enabled by default on platforms which
    support Vulkan, i.e. non-Apple operating systems and not the web).
  - `"ffmpeg_vp8"` - Software VP8 decoder based on FFmpeg.
  - `"ffmpeg_vp9"` - Software VP9 decoder based on FFmpeg.
  - `"any"` - Automatically selects any video decoder supported by Smelter.
