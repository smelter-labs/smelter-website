The `View` component serves as the core layout mechanism in the Smelter, similar to the `<div>` tag in HTML. It acts as a container that offers basic styling options and can be further customized and composed.

## Example

Below is an example of how View can be used in output stream. In this case, output is solid green window.

<CollapsibleDetails summaryTitle='Update output' open>
```http ins={7}
POST: /api/output/example_output/update
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "video": {
    "root": {
      "type": "view",
      "background_color": "#008000FF",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    }
  }
}
```
</CollapsibleDetails>

type View = {
  id?: string;
  children?: Component[];

## Positioning

### Absolute
A component is absolutely positioned when it specifies style properties such as top, left, right, bottom, or rotation. These properties determine the component's position relative to its parent. However, the parent component must support absolute positioning for these values to take effect.
- `View` supports absolute positioning for its child components. If the `width` and `height` are not explicitly provided, an absolutely positioned child will inherit `width` and `height` from its parent.
- `View` can be absolutely positioned relative to its parent if the parent component supports it.

### Static
When children of a `View` component have a static position, they are placed next to each other.


#### For `direction=row`:

Children of a `View` component form a row, with items aligned to the top. The size of each child will be calculated in the following way:
- If the `width` or `height` of a child component is defined, then those values take priority.
- If the `height` is not defined, the component will have the same `height` as its parent.
- If the `width` is not defined, we calculate the sum `width` of all components with that value defined.
  - If it is larger than the parent's `width`, then the `width` of the rest of the components is zero.
  - If it is smaller than the parent's `width`, calculate the difference and divide the resulting value equally between all children with unknown widths.

#### For `direction=column`:

Analogous to the `direction=row` case, but children form a column instead, with items aligned to the left.

### Transitions

On the scene update, a `View` component will animate between the original state and the new one if the `transition` field is defined. Both the original and the new scene need to define a component with the same `id`. Currently, only some of the fields support animated transitions:

- `width` / `height` - Only supported within the same positioning mode. If the positioning mode changes between the old scene and the new one, the transition will not work.
- `bottom` / `top` / `left` / `right` / `rotation` - Only supports transition when changing a value of the same field. If the old scene defines a `left` field and the new one does not, the transition will not work.

## Properties

### id
ID of component.

- **Type**: `string`

### children
List of component's children.

- **Type**: `Component[]`

### width
Width of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `f32`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a [layout component](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), the `width` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are [layout components](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

### height
Height of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `f32`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a [layout component](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), the `height` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are [layout components](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

### direction
Defines how static children are positioned inside a View component.

- **Type**: `"row" | "column"`
- **Default value**: `"row"`
- **Supported values**:
    - `"row"` - Children are positioned from left to right.
    - `"column"` - Children are positioned from top to bottom.

---

### top
Specifies the distance in pixels from the top edge of a component to the top edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### left
Specifies the distance in pixels from the left edge of a component to the left edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### bottom
Specifies the distance in pixels from the bottom edge of a component to the bottom edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### right
Specifies the distance in pixels from the right edge of a component to the right edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### rotation
Specifies the rotation of a component, measured in degrees. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### transition
Defines how this component will behave during a scene update. This will only have an effect if the previous scene already contained a `View` component with the same id.

- **Type**: [`Transition`](#transition-1)

---

### overflow
Controls the behaviour of the content exceeding the area size.

- **Type**: `"visible" | "hidden" | "fit"`
- **Default value**: `"hidden"`
- **Supported values**:
    - `"visible"` - Render everything, including content that extends beyond their parent.
    - `"hidden"` - Render only parts of the children that are inside their parent area.
    - `"fit"` - If children components are too big to fit inside the parent, resize everything inside to fit.

<Aside>When using `fit`, components with unknown sizes are treated as if they had a size of 0 when calculating the scaling factor.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">`fit` will resize everything inside the parent, including absolutely positioned elements.</Aside>

  offset_y?: f32;
  color?: string;
  blur_radius?: f32;
}
```
### Properties

## EasingFunction
```typescript
type EasingFunction = 
  | { function_name: "linear"; }
  | { function_name: "bounce"; }
  | {
      function_name: "cubic_bezier";
      points: [f64, f64, f64, f64];
    }
```
Easing functions are used to interpolate between two values over time.

Custom easing functions can be implemented with cubic Bézier.
The control points are defined with `points` field by providing four numerical values: `x1`, `y1`, `x2` and `y2`. The `x1` and `x2` values have to be in the range `[0; 1]`. The cubic Bézier result is clamped to the range `[0; 1]`.
You can find example control point configurations [here](https://easings.net/).

### Properties

#### function_name
Duration of a transition in milliseconds.

- **Type**: `linear | bounce | cubic_bezier`
- **Default value**: `linear`
- **Supported values**:
    - `linear`
    - `bounce`
    - `cubic_bezier`
---

#### points
Four numerical values in `[0; 1]` range used for cubic Bézier. The result is clamped to the range `[0; 1]`.

- **Type**: `[f64, f64, f64, f64]`
