import { Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Applies shader transformations to its children using a WGSL shader. For more information on using shaders in Live Compositor, please visit [Shaders documentation]().

<Aside>To use this component, you need to first register the image with a matching `shaderId` using the [`LiveCompositor.registerShader`]() function.</Aside>

## Example

## Props

### shaderId
ID of a shader. It identifies a shader registered using a [LiveCompositor.registerShader]() method.

- Type: `string`

---

### children
A single child component to be transformed.

- Type: `ReactNode`

---

### id
ID of a component.

- Type: `string`
- Default value: Value produced by `useId` hook

---

### shaderParam
Object that will be serialized into a struct and passed to the shader as `@group(1) @binding(0) var<uniform>`. ShaderParam object must match the structure defined in a shader source code.

- Type: [`ShaderParam`](/reference/ts-sdk/props/rescaler-style-props)

<Aside>Right now, we don't handle memory layout automatically. To get the correct memory alignment, you might need to add some extra fields as padding. Visit the [WGSL documentation]() for more details.</Aside>

---

### resolution
Resolution of the texture where shader will be executed.

- Type: `{ width: number; height: number;}`
