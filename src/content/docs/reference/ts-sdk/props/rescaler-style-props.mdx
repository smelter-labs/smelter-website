import { Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### Props

#### id
Id of a component.

- Type: `string`
- Default value: Value produced by `useId` hook

---

#### children
List of component's children.

- Type: `ReactNode`

---

#### mode
Content resize mode.

- Type: `"fit" | "fill"`
- Default value: `"fit"`
- Supported values:
    - `"fit"` - Resizes the component to match one dimension of the parent while ensuring it remains fully visible.
    - `"fill"` - Resizes the component to cover the entire area of the parent by matching at least one dimension; excess is clipped.

---

#### width
Width of a component in pixels.

- Type: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `Rescaler` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `width` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

#### height
Height of a component in pixels.

- Type: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `Rescaler` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `height` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.

---

#### top
Specifies the distance in pixels from the top edge of this component to the top edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### right
Specifies the distance in pixels from the right edge of this component to the right edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### bottom
Specifies the distance in pixels from the bottom edge of this component to the bottom edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### left
Specifies the distance in pixels from the left edge of this component to the left edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`

---

#### horizontalAlign
Horizontal alignment.

- Type: `"left" | "right" | "justified" | "center"`
- Default value: `"center"`

---

#### verticalAlign
Vertical alignment.

- Type: `"top" | "center" | "bottom" | "justified"`
- Default value: `"center"`

---

#### transition
Defines how this component will behave during a scene update. This will only have an effect if the previous scene already contained a `Rescaler` component with the same `id`.

- Type: `Transition`

---

#### rotation
Specifies the rotation of a component, measured in degrees. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- Type: `number`
