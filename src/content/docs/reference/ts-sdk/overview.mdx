TypeScript SDK is a library that provides a set of React components, hooks, and utility functions you can use to control how Live Compositor manipulates videos. In this section, we'll briefly describe its interface so you can get the general impression of how to process multimedia using Live Compositor TypeScript SDK. 

### Components
Live Compositor TypeScript SDK draws heavy inspiration from React Native in terms of the synthax. It's important to note that standard DOM components, such as `<div/>`, are not supported. Instead, you should use LiveCompositor-specific components, such as:
- [Image](/reference/ts-sdk/components/image)
- [InputStream](/reference/ts-sdk/components/input-stream)
- [Rescaler](/reference/ts-sdk/components/rescaler)
- [Shader](/reference/ts-sdk/components/shader)
- [Text](/reference/ts-sdk/components/text)
- [Tiles](/reference/ts-sdk/components/tiles)
- [View](/reference/ts-sdk/components/view)
- [WebView](/reference/ts-sdk/components/web-view)

#### Styling
Live Compositor components can be customized in a way similar to React inline styling. Most of the components accept `style` prop - an object defining custom visual aspects. However, some of the animation-related customizations, such as `transition` are handled by specific dedicated props.

### Hooks
Our hooks are primarily designed for managing stream configurations and accessing information about them. Live Compositor currently offers two hooks:
- [useInputStreams](/reference/ts-sdk/hooks/use-input-streams)
- [useInputAudio](/reference/ts-sdk/hooks/use-input-audio)

You're free to use any standard React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and more.

### Inputs
You can handle most of the stream composing by using React components. However, delivering multimedia to the compositor requires registering the input beforehand. You can register an input by using [LiveCompositor.registerInput](), which accepts `inputId` and `inputType`. Right now, we support two input types:
- [MP4](/reference/ts-sdk/inputs/mp4)
- [RTP](/reference/ts-sdk/inputs/rtp)

After registering the stream, you can use it in composition by using [InputStream](/) component. 

<Code code={`<InputStream inputId="example_input" />`} lang="js" />

### Outputs
Similar to inputs, outputs require registering them before they can be utilized. You can register an output by using `LiveCompositor.registerOutput`. Currently, we support the same output types as input types:
- [MP4](/reference/ts-sdk/outputs/mp4)
- [RTP](/reference/ts-sdk/outputs/rtp)

### Renderers
<b>Describe renerers</b> Right now we support three renderers:
- [Shader](/reference/ts-sdk/renderers/shader)
- [Image](/reference/ts-sdk/renderers/image)
- [WebRenderer](/reference/ts-sdk/renderers/web-renderer)
