## How to get images?

### Image registry

Image are available in `ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter` registry.

Available image tags:
- `v{VERSION}` e.g. `v0.4.0` - Base version
- `v{VERSION}-web-renderer` e.g. `v0.4.0` - Base version with web rendering enabled. Includes Chromium Embedded Framework.

### Build your own image

If you need to customize something or just want to build the images yourself you can find Dockerfiles in:
- [`build_tools/docker/slim.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/slim.Dockerfile) - Base version
- [`build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile) - Smelter version with web rendering enabled. Includes Chromium Embedded Framework.

To build it, run:
```
docker build -f build_tools/docker/slim.Dockerfile -t smelter .
```

## Enabling hardware acceleration

By default, if you run
```sh frame=none
docker run -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter
```
it will launch the server in the CPU only mode. Encoding and decoding will be purely CPU based, and
rendering will be emulated using LLVMpipe.

To leverage the power of your GPU you need to pass it to the docker container:

### AMD GPU - Linux

Add `--device /dev/dri` to your docker run command to pass GPU access to the container.

```sh frame=none
docker run 
    --device /dev/dri
    -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter
```

### Nvidia GPU - Linux

Add `--gpus all --runtime=nvidia` to your docker run command to pass GPU access to the container.

```sh frame=none
docker run 
    --gpus all --runtime=nvidia
    -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter
```

### Hardware requirements

Smelter can fully work on the machine with CPU only, but to leverage GPU acceleration your hardware
and drivers needs to meet some requirements.

#### WebGPU features

To support GPU-based rendering your hardware and drivers needs to support specific features.

Required features:
- `TEXTURE_BINDING_ARRAY`
- `PUSH_CONSTANTS`

Enabled by default, but it can be disabled:
- `SAMPLED_TEXTURE_AND_STORAGE_BUFFER_ARRAY_NON_UNIFORM_INDEXING`
- `UNIFORM_BUFFER_AND_STORAGE_TEXTURE_ARRAY_NON_UNIFORM_INDEXING`

Those options are enabled by default, but can be disabled using
[`SMELTER_REQUIRED_WGPU_FEATURES`](/deployment/configuration#smelter_required_wgpu_features) environment variable.

:::note
All of the above features should be available on almost any GPU. If you are getting an error
about unsupported features, then most likely, the issue is caused by missing or too old drivers.
:::

#### Hardware decoding

To leverage hardware decoding, your GPU and drivers need to support following Vulkan extension;

- `VK_KHR_video_queue`
- `VK_KHR_video_decode_queue`
- `VK_KHR_video_decode_h264`
