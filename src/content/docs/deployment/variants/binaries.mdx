## How to get binaries

You can get Smelter binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/releases) or build them yourself.

### GitHub releases

GitHub Releases section includes binaries for:
- `smelter_linux_x86_64.tar.gz` - Linux x86 default build.
- `smelter_linux_aarch64.tar.gz` - Linux ARM default build.
- `smelter_darwin_aarch64.tar.gz` - macOS (ARM) default build.
- `smelter_darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` - macOS (Intel-based) default build.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_linux_x86_64.tar.gz` - Linux x86 build with web rendering enabled.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_darwin_aarch64.tar.gz` - macOS (ARM) with web rendering enabled.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` - macOS (Intel-based) with web rendering enabled

Web rendering increases the size of the binaries significantly, so the base binaries are built without
support for it included.


#### Runtime requirements

For Linux:
- FFmpeg 6
- `glibc` 2.35 or higher (version used by Ubuntu 22.04)
- MESA (e.g. `mesa-vulkan-drivers` package on Ubuntu)
  - `23.2.1` or higher for CPU based rendering
  - For GPU based rendering the lowest version we tested was `22.0.1`, but older version might also work.

For macOS:
- FFmpeg 7 (this version will mostly follow a default version available in Homebrew)

<Aside>
Changing FFmpeg version on macOS might be troublesome, so we decided to produce binaries that will
be easiest to use for most users, even if this means updating FFmpeg version in a minor or patch release.
Changes like that might be considered unsafe, but in case of Smelter, the macOS platform will be used
mostly for development, and it is highly unlikely to be used for a production deployment.

### Building from source

#### Prerequisites

To build base version without web rendering you will need:
- FFmpeg 6 or higher. Build time version has to be the same as runtime version.
- Rust toolchain.
- Following libraries (for build time you will need version with header files if your distro ships them separately):
  - FFmpeg dependencies: `libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavfilter`, `libavdevice`, `libavutil`, `libswscale`, `libswresample`
  - `libopus`
  - `libssl`
- cmake
- pkg-config

Linux specific (with a Vulkan backend):
- MESA
  - `23.2.1` or higher for CPU based rendering
  - For GPU based rendering the lowest version we tested was `22.0.1`, but older version might also work.
  - e.g. for Ubuntu
    - build time: `apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dri libxcb-xfixes0-dev`
    - runtime: `apt-get install mesa-vulkan-drivers`

To build version with web rendering support you will also need runtime dependencies of Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).
See [their documentation](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) for details or our Dockerfile ([`build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile)).

#### Building

Building base version without web rendering support:
```sh frame=none
cargo build --no-default-features
```

Building version with web rendering support:
```sh frame=none
cargo build
```
