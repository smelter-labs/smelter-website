## How to get binaries

You can get Smelter binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/releases) or build them yourself.

### GitHub releases

GitHub Releases section includes binaries for:
- `smelter_linux_x86_64.tar.gz` - Linux x86 default build.
- `smelter_linux_aarch64.tar.gz` - Linux ARM default build.
- `smelter_darwin_aarch64.tar.gz` - macOS (ARM) default build.
- `smelter_darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` - macOS (Intel-based) default build.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_linux_x86_64.tar.gz` - Linux x86 build with web rendering enabled.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_darwin_aarch64.tar.gz` - macOS (ARM) with web rendering enabled.
- `smelter_with_web_renderer_darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` - macOS (Intel-based) with web rendering enabled

Web rendering increases the size of the binaries significantly, so the base binaries are built without
support for it included.


#### Runtime requirements

For Linux:
- FFmpeg 6 or higher
- `glibc` 2.35 or higher (version used by Ubuntu 22.04)
- MESA (e.g. `mesa-vulkan-drivers` package on Ubuntu)
  - `23.2.1` or higher for CPU based rendering
  - For GPU based rendering the lowest version we tested was `22.0.1`, but older version might also work.

For macOS:
- FFmpeg 6 or higher

### Building from source

#### Prerequisites

To build base version without web rendering you will need:
- FFmpeg 6 or higher. Build time version has to be the same as runtime version.
- Rust toolchain.
- Following libraries (for build time you will need version with header files if your distro ships them separately):
  - FFmpeg dependencies: `libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavfilter`, `libavdevice`, `libavutil`, `libswscale`, `libswresample`
  - `libopus`
  - `libssl`
- cmake
- pkg-config

Linux specific (with a Vulkan backend):
- MESA
  - `23.2.1` or higher for CPU based rendering
  - For GPU based rendering the lowest version we tested was `22.0.1`, but older version might also work.
  - e.g. for Ubuntu
    - build time: `apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dri libxcb-xfixes0-dev`
    - runtime: `apt-get install mesa-vulkan-drivers`

To build version with web rendering support you will also need runtime dependencies of Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).
See [their documentation](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef) for details or our Dockerfile ([`build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile)).

#### Building

Building base version without web rendering support:
```sh frame=none
cargo build --no-defatult-features
```

Building version with web rendering support:
```sh frame=none
cargo build
```
