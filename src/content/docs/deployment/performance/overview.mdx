Smelter performance is highly dependent on the runtime, hardware, and the feature set you need. It is a 
great choice in some scenarios, but suboptimal in others.

## When to use Smelter?

Smelter is very efficient if you need a solution that will decode, modify raw frames and 
encode it back. However, if you only need some of those features there might be a better
solution for you out there.

You should use Smelter:
- If you need to modify video content (add overlay, combine multiple sources, add some text or effects)
- You need to transcode the video to a different codec.
- You need to generate output in multiple resolutions.

You should not use Smelter:
- If you want to convert your stream into different protocol or format. For example, convert incoming
  RTMP stream into HLS playlist.
- If you want to re-stream something to more viewers. For example, broadcast incoming WHIP stream over WHEP 
  consider a solution like <a href="https://fishjam.io/" target="_blank">Fishjam</a> instead.

## Key performance factors

The processing pipeline in Smelter consists of many components. However, only a few specific factors
have deciding impact on the performance. We can divide or heaviest workloads into following categories:
- decoding - Converting encoded video e.g. H264 into raw frames (2D array of bytes representing specific pixels).
- rendering - Process that takes set of frames (one for each input) and produces set of frames (one for each output).
- encoding - Converting stream of raw frames (2D array of bytes representing specific pixels) into encoded video e.g. H264

## Runtimes

You can run Smelter on the server or in the browser. Each environment has its own performance bottlenecks.
