Smelter performance is highly dependent on a runtime, hardware and the feature set you need.

> For example, Smelter is a media server for composing media, we are always decoding input streams
and encoding output stream. However, if you just want to receive some stream e.g. via WebRTC and
re-broadcast it efficiently, consider solutions like [Fishjam](https://fishjam.io/).

## Key performance factors

The most important factor affecting performance is how much work we are doing on the GPU and how much on
CPU. We can divide or heaviest workloads into following categories:
- decoding - Converting encoded video e.g. H264 into raw frames (2D array of bytes representing specific pixels).
- rendering - Process that takes set of frames (one for each input) and produces set of frames (one for each output).
- encoding - Converting stream of raw frames (2D array of bytes representing specific pixels) into encoded video e.g. H264

> There are of course other parts, for example, handling network protocols, container formats, processing audio. However, they
are inconsequential in terms of performance.

## Runtimes

You can run Smelter on the server or in the browser. Each environment has its own performance bottlenecks.

See [media server](/deployment/performance/server) and [browser WASM module](/deployment/performance/browser) performance overview.
