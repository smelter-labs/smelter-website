## Rendering

Rendering process in browser is based on the same code as server. Regular Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly and
`wgpu` crate is using WebGL from the browser as a backend. As a result you are getting performance a bit worse than directly
using a browser canvas, but packaged with variation of input/outputs packaged in simple API.

Performance might differ significantly between different browser versions and operating systems. Often the 
biggest problem is passing frames to and from WASM renderer. On some platforms it is extremely cheap, on others it takes
more time than the rest of the rendering process, even though it is the same WebGL call.

## Decoding/Encoding

Relies on browser implementation of decoders and encoders. Smelter code has only minimal control over them.
