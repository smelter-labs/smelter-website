Smelter can be deployed in various ways, depending on your platform, used features and whether it is
used standalone or via SDK (TypeScript or Membrane Framework plugin).

### Standalone server 

Standalone server can be deployed by:
- [Using docker images from `ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter`](/deployment/variants/docker/#image-registry)
- [Building your own docker images](/deployment/variants/docker/#build-your-own-image)
- [Using binaries from GitHub release](/deployment/variants/binaries/#github-releases)
- [Building from source](/deployment/variants/binaries/#building-from-source)

Each of SDKs listed below implements a way to automatically provision a Smelter server. However, standalone guides
above will still be useful even if you are using Smelter from TypeScript or Elixir (Membrane Framework). For example,
you might want to build binaries or deploy the server yourself, and just use SDK to manage that instance.

### TypeScript SDK - Node.js 

When using TypeScript SDK, the Node.js process will execute only the React code, but actual
rendering and media processing will happen in a separate process. By default, SDK downloads
compositor binaries and starts a new Smelter servers on its own. However, you can also connect
to an existing instance that you start yourself.

First, you need to decide:
- Where will your React code run?
- Where will your Smelter server run?

The easiest and the most practical scenario would be to:
- For production run both Node.js and Smelter server in the same Docker container.
- For development run Node.js on your machine and Smelter server locally (either directly or in a Docker container).

<Aside>
It is possible to run your React code on the different machine than Smelter server. However,
it is only useful in very limited circumstances, for example if you are running untrusted 
JavaScript that controls the streams.

### TypeScript SDK - Browser (WASM)

When running Smelter in browser everything is purely client-side, so there is no need
to deploy anything, but there are some additional steps you need to take to configure
your project.

### Membrane Framework plugin

To use Smelter in a Membrane pipeline you can use [`membrane_smelter_plugin`](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_smelter_plugin/readme.html)
that wraps our server. For instructions how to deploy Membrane based applications check out [their documentation](https://membrane.stream/learn).

The plugin serves as a bridge between Membrane and the Smelter server, which must still be deployed. By default, the plugin will
download the necessary binaries and launch the server locally, but you must ensure that all software and hardware requirements are met.
