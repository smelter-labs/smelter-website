HTTP API is the most direct way to configure and manage a Smelter server. This section
will highlight the base element that you need to be familiar to leverage this API.

### Routes

List of all HTTP routes can be found [here](/http-api/0.5.x/routes).

### Events

Smelter can deliver events in response to certain state changes. To receive them
you need to establish WebSocket connection to
[this endpoint](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#websocket-endpoint).

See [events page](/http-api/0.5.x/events) to learn more.

### Components

Components are a fundamental building blocks for configuring video composition. Some of them
represent final elements that will be rendered on an output stream, and some are just
a way to define a layout for their child components.

A scene is a component tree assigned to a specific Smelter output. It starts with a root
component and includes are its children (both direct and indirect). Scene can be defined
when:

* registering a new output - [request](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#register-output)
* updating a scene of existing output - [request](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#update-output)

Smelter supports following components:

* [Image](/http-api/0.5.x/components/image)
* [InputStream](/http-api/0.5.x/components/inputstream)
* [Rescaler](/http-api/0.5.x/components/rescaler)
* [Shader](/http-api/0.5.x/components/shader)
* [Text](/http-api/0.5.x/components/text)
* [Tiles](/http-api/0.5.x/components/tiles)
* [View](/http-api/0.5.x/components/view)
* [WebView](/http-api/0.5.x/components/webview)

### Inputs

Inputs are a way of connecting external video and audio sources. They can consume media from
static files, streams or connected devices. To use an input you need to register it first with
a [input register request](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#register-input). After registration, you can use
[InputStream](/http-api/0.5.x/components/inputstream) component in the scene definition to include
it in the composed output.

* [RTP](/http-api/0.5.x/inputs/rtp)
* [WHEP](/http-api/0.5.x/inputs/whep)
* [WHIP](/http-api/0.5.x/inputs/whip)
* [HLS](/http-api/0.5.x/inputs/hls)
* [DeckLink](/http-api/0.5.x/inputs/decklink)

### Outputs

Similar to inputs, outputs require registering them before they can be utilized. You can register an output by using [output register request](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#register-output). Part of the register requests are fields `video.initial` and `audio.initial` that describe starting scene that can be latter updated with [output update request](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#update-output)

* [MP4](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/mp4)
* [RTP](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/rtp)
* [WHEP](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/whep)
* [WHIP](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/whip)
* [RTMP](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/rtmp)
* [HLS](/http-api/0.5.x/outputs/hls)

### Resources

Other than inputs and outputs, Smelter supports a few other types of entities that also need to be registered.

* [Shader](/http-api/0.5.x/resources/shader)
* [Image](/http-api/0.5.x/resources/image)
* [WebRenderer](/http-api/0.5.x/resources/web-renderer)
* [Fonts](/http-api/0.5.x/routes#register-font)
