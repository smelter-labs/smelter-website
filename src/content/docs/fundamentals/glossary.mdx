### Offline processing

Offline processing represents a mode where Smelter is operating only non-real time inputs and
outputs e.g. combining 2 mp4 files into one. In particular in this mode, the processing time is
not tied to the real time, processing progresses as fast as hardware allows.

### Live processing

Live processing represents a mode where Smelter is operating on some real time inputs or outputs.
Processing will be synchronized with real time clock (plus some buffer).

### Timestamp

Unless stated otherwise all user-facing timestamps are defined in milliseconds and measure time
from the queue start.

For offline processing it measures the time of the processed stream. This value is different than
real (wall-clock) time, because offline processing might be faster or slower than real-time.

### Input

Input is an entity that needs to be registered before use and can be used as a source of frames.
For example, incoming RTP stream or MP4 file.

### Output

Output is an entity that needs to be registered before use and can be used as a destination for generated frames.
For example, outgoing RTP stream or writing to disk as MP4 file.

### Resource

Resource is an entity that needs to be registered before use, but it is neither an [Input](#input) nor an [Output](#output).
For example, shader source, font, or an image.
