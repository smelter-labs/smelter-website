### Offline processing

Offline processing represents a mode where Smelter is operating only on non-real time inputs and
outputs e.g. combining 2 mp4 files into one. In this mode, the processing time is fully decoupled
from the real time and progresses as fast as hardware allows it.

### Live processing

Live processing represents a mode where Smelter is operating on any real time inputs or outputs.
Processing will be synchronized to the real-time (wall) clock, meaning a 1-second segment of video
will take approximately 1 second to process.

### Timestamp

Unless stated otherwise all user-facing timestamps are defined in milliseconds and measure time
from the queue start. Note that "time" in this context means time of the processed audio/video
streams, so it might be different from the real (wall clock) time. 

Example scenario:
- You are converting 5 minute MP4 file. Processing took 2 minutes to complete, but the current timestamp
  when the processing ended will be 5 minutes.
- You have a real-time "required" input that is delivered to slowly (e.g. network throughput, hardware bottleneck).
  As a result, the current timestamp will fall behind the wall clock time.

### Input

Input is an entity that needs to be registered before use and can be used as a source of frames.
For example, incoming RTP stream or MP4 file.

##### Offset

Input offset is a [timestamp](#timestamp) that represents start of the stream (relative to the queue start). If offset
is not defined, then it is calculated based on arrival time of the first packet.

##### Required

Input marked as required will force a Smelter to block until data for the current [timestamp](#timestamp) is available.

In most cases:
 - All inputs should be required in offline processing.
 - None of the inputs should be required in live processing.

However, there are specific situations, when mixing those options can make sense.

### Output

Output is an entity that needs to be registered before use and can be used as a destination for generated frames.
For example, outgoing RTP stream or writing to disk as MP4 file.

### Resource

Resource is an entity that needs to be registered before use, but it is neither an [Input](#input) nor an [Output](#output).
For example, shader source, font, or an image.
