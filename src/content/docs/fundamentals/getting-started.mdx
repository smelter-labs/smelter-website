## What is Smelter?

Smelter is an engine for real-time video processing built by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://swmansion.com/" target="_blank">Software Mansion</a>. It provides functionalities to apply custom effects, mix, and combine multiple videos together. By exposing an HTTP API, Smelter enables users to define video sources, specify modifications, and composition settings.

## Quick start

You can use Smelter in a few ways, however we recommend the TypeScript SDK as the best option right now.

### Typescript SDK

TypeScript SDK is a library that provides a set of React components you can use to control how Smelter 
manipulates videos. Currently, we support running TypeScript SDK in Node.js environment and browser.

You can generate a new starter project using the following commands:
<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
    ```sh frame=none
    npx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```sh frame=none
    pnpx create-smelter-app 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```sh frame=none
    yarn create smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
    ```sh frame=none
    bunx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Standalone

You can use Smelter as a standalone multimedia server. The server can be started by:
- Building from sources [`github.com/software-mansion/smelter`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter).
- Using binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/releases).
- Using Docker
  - (recommended) Dockerfile with compositor without web rendering support [`[Dockerfile]`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/slim.Dockerfile)
  - Dockerfile with compositor with web rendering support [`[Dockerfile]`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/blob/master/build_tools/docker/full.Dockerfile)


### Membrane Framework plugin

Membrane is a multimedia processing framework written in Elixir. Smelter implements a plugin that allows injecting itself into Membrane pipeline. 

<Aside>Membrane has its own way of handling multimedia, so there are some notable differences in comparison to the standalone Smelter. Visit [the plugin documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_live_compositor_plugin/0.9.0/Membrane.LiveCompositor.html) to learn more.</Aside>
