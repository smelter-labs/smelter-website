## What is Smelter?

Smelter is a toolkit for real-time video processing built by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://swmansion.com/" target="_blank">Software Mansion</a>.

With Smelter you can:
- Combine multimedia from different sources into a single video or live stream.
- Enrich your content with text, custom shaders, and embedded websites.
- Do it all effortlessly with React components or directly via HTTP API.

## Quick start

You can use Smelter in a few ways, however we recommend the TypeScript SDK as the best option to get started.

### Typescript SDK

TypeScript SDK is a set of libraries that provide React components you can use to control how Smelter 
manipulates videos. Currently, we support running TypeScript SDK in Node.js environment and browser.

You can generate a new starter project using the following commands:
<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
    ```sh frame=none
    npx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```sh frame=none
    pnpx create-smelter-app 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```sh frame=none
    yarn create smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
    ```sh frame=none
    bunx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
  
To learn more, explore <a href="/ts-sdk">TypeScript SDK documentation</a> or check out [step-by-step guides](/ts-sdk/guides/quick-start).

### Standalone

You can use Smelter as a standalone multimedia server. The server can be started by:
- Building from sources [`github.com/software-mansion/smelter`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter).
- Using binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/releases).
- Using Docker [`ghcr.io/software-mansion/smelter`](https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/pkgs/container/smelter).


### Membrane Framework plugin

Membrane is a multimedia processing framework written in Elixir. You can use it with Smelter via `membrane_live_compositor_plugin`.
It integrates a Smelter server into the Membrane pipeline.
