## What is Smelter?

Smelter is an engine for real-time video processing built by <a href="https://swmansion.com/" target="_blank">Software Mansion</a>. It provides functionalities to apply custom effects, mix, and combine multiple videos together. By exposing an HTTP API, Smelter enables users to define video sources, specify modifications, and composition settings.

## Quick start

You can use Smelter in a few ways, however we recommend the TypeScript SDK as the best option right now.

### Typescript SDK

TypeScript SDK is a library that provides a set of React components you can use to control how Smelter manipulates videos. Currently, we only support running TypeScript SDK in Node.js environment, but browser and React Native support will be added soon.

You can generate a new starter project using the following commands:
<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
    ```sh frame=none
    npx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```sh frame=none
    pnpxcreate-smelter-app 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```sh frame=none
    yarn create smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
    ```sh frame=none
    bunx create-smelter-app
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Standalone

**Some intro with multimedia server** You can use Smelter as a standalone multimedia server. The server can be started by:


### Membrane Framework plugin

Membrane is a multimedia processing framework written in Elixir. **Why use it**, **Cases where it is recommended**, **Redirect to docs**

<Aside>Membrane has its own way of handling multimedia, so there are some notable differences in comparison to the standalone Smelter. Visit <a href="">Membrane plugin section</a> for more details.</Aside>
