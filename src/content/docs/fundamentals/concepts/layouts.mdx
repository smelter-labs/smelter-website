title: Layouts
---
Layout components define the size, position, and simple styling of other components.

Currently, we support the following layout components:

- `View` ([TypeScript](/ts-sdk/components/view))
- `Tiles` ([TypeScript](/ts-sdk/components/tiles))
- `Rescaler` ([TypeScript](/ts-sdk/components/rescaler))

### Common properties
Layout components share some of the properties, the main exception being `Tiles`, which assumes that the properties will be applied directly to its children.

#### Sizing
- `width` - Width of a component in pixels.
- `height` - Height of a component in pixels.

Sizing of the layout components varies depending on their parent and position in the component tree, as detailed in the table below:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Layout component placement</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Layout component size</strong></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Root in a component tree</td>
      <td>Size is based on the declared resolution of an output stream.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Child of a non-layout component</td>
      <td>Defining size is required, usually via the `width`/`height` fields</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Child of another layout component</td>
      <td>Size will be based on the area defined by its parent unless explicitly defined.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

#### Absolute positioning
- `top` - Distance in pixels from the top edge of a component to the top edge of its parent component.
- `bottom` - Distance in pixels from the bottom edge of a component to the bottom edge of its parent component.
- `left` - Distance in pixels from the left edge of a component to the left edge of its parent component.
- `right` - Distance in pixels from the right edge of a component to the right edge of its parent component.
- `rotation` - Rotation in degrees.

All the properties above imply the absolute positioning of a component.

When a component is positioned absolutely, it will ignore the normal layout of its parent.
